2. Open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux).

   ```bash
   cd path
   #replace path with path to unzip folder
4. Install libraries that require for running programs:

5. If you can't run `pip`, Try `py` instead:
   ```bash
   py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   
6. run main programs:
   ```bash
   python app.py
